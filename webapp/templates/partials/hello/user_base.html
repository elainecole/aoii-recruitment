        <!-- <strong>*Please prepare for the PNM Study (where we will review each PNM & if sisters know the PNM they will have a brief opportunity to talk about her). For each PNM you know please prepare a 1-2 sentence description of how you know her, her personality and who you think she would talk well with for the matching committee. Note: this is not a time to vent or gossip about a PNM, it is a time for the chapter to familiarize themselves with the PNMs and the matching committee to gain more information about the PNMS in order to facilitate meaningful conversations during parties. Please keep this in mind as we want to be efficient as possible with about 500 PNMs -->
